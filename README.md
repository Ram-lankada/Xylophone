# Xylophone App

Just made this project while learning Flutter. More projects on the way!!!

## Getting Started

Got stuck at using AudioCache(). I know it well. It was a bit deprecated in Xylophone music playing.
This project is upgraded with the AudioCache that was deprecated in usage. Therefore used AudioPlayer but setting the Asset source of the Audio files & played it using it.
